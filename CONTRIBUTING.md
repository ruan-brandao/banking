# Contributing

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute with the project! All help is welcome.
You can contribute with code, ideas, documentation, or by reporting bugs.

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ruan-brandao/banking/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [License](https://github.com/ruan-brandao/banking/blob/master/LICENSE).

In order to contribute with ideas or bug reporting, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/ruan-brandao/banking/issues/new) in the project.
But before doing that, check the existing issues to avoid creating a duplicate.

## Contributing with code

To contribute with code you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the project
2. Clone your fork to your workstation with the command `git clone <YOUR_FORK_URL>`
3. Create a new feature branch to make your changes to the code with the command `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
4. Make your changes to the code using descriptive commit messages. Also write tests if applicable
5. Make sure all the tests are passing
6. Push your code to your fork on GitHub `git push origin your-branch-name`
7. Go to your fork page on GitHub and open a new Pull Request
8. Leave a message on the Pull Request page with any useful info for the maintainers to review the code

We will review your Pull Request and, if approved, your modifications will be merged.
We cannot guarantee that all pull requests will be merged, but rejected requests will have an explanation for that.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact one of the project's maintainers.

Thanks! :heart:
